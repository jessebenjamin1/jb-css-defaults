# JB CSS Defaults

If anyone ever looks at this I'm just keeping some default styles I like in a repo for easy access in the future.

Feel free to use them, just be aware that this is not a tidy repo and there may be colours, fonts, and other things set that you may not want.

Have fun writing CSS âœ¨ðŸ’ƒâœ¨
